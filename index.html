    <p>On this page I will be explaining what a website means. A website is a set of interconnected <strong>webpages</strong>, usually including a homepage, generally located on the same <em>server</em>, and prepared and maintained as a collection of information by a person, group, or organization. This is acutally me learning how to create a website starting with the home page. </p>
