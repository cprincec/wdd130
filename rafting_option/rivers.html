                        <p>The Salmon River flows 425 miles, drains over 14,000 square miles and drops more than 7,000
                            vertical feet from its headwaters. Natural and untamed, the Salmon River is protected by
                            Congress as one of America’s first Wild and Scenic Rivers. It has shaped its course through
                            a rugged and diverse landscape providing unique river trips you will only experience in
                            Idaho. The Salmon River flows through the vast Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness and is
                            the second deepest gorge on the American continent. The Salmon River is divided by name into
                            different sections, namely the Main Salmon, the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and the
                            Lower Salmon. Any section of the Salmon River rafting is perfect for your family or group
                            getaway with a great mixture of fun rapids, calm floats, great swimming and peaceful
                            camping.</p>
                        <p>Salmon River, river rising in the Sawtooth and Salmon River mountains, south Custer county,
                            central Idaho, U.S. It flows generally northeast past the city of Salmon, where it is joined
                            by the Lemhi River, and then northwest to join the Snake River several miles south of the
                            Idaho-Oregon-Washington border after a course of about 420 miles (676 km). The Salmon is the
                            largest tributary of the Snake and flows through an extensive wildlife area of national
                            forests. The section of the river midway between Salmon city and its confluence with the
                            Snake is called the “River of No Return” because travel upstream was once impossible. Salmon
                            River Canyon, a gorge 30 miles (48 km) long, 1 mile (1.6 km) deep, and in places 10 miles

                            challenge than running Gauley River rapids. This is no lazy river tube ride. This is serious
                            class V whitewater rafting. Previous experience is highly recommended… and the reward is

                        <p>Known for its dramatic canyons, whitewater rapids, and eleven U.S. National Parks, the
                            Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people.[6]
                            The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams, reservoirs,
                            and aqueducts, which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation
                            and domestic water supply.[7][8] Additionally, some of its waters are transported via a
                            series of dams, tunnels, and canals into the Rio Grande watershed.[9] Its large flow and
                            steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power, and its major dams regulate
                            peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West. Intensive water consumption has
                            dried up the lower 100 miles (160 km) of the river, which has rarely reached the sea.
                            The 225 miles of Colorado River that stretch from Lees Ferry to Diamond Creek are most
                            notable for their whitewater rapids. It's a thrilling rush through American geological
                            history, as rafters pass Paleozoic walls that are a half-billion years old. There are 42
                            major rapids, many of which are not for the faint of heart. The rafting adventure takes
                            visitors to famous sites like Lava Falls, the limestone chamber of Redwall Cavern, and
                            some of the biggest whitewater rapids in the canyon -- including the Crystal, Sapphire,
                            Turquoise and Ruby rapids -- which will likely leave you shrieking with excitement.</p>
